# CloudBasedDedicatedGameServerFramework
An open-source framework for a cloud-enabled dedicated game server system that allows a game to exist on multiple systems run and managed by a community of people. The idea would be to lower the cost of entry for MMORPGs by allowing the resources to be crowd sourced in essence and divest the cost of managing the server space for a game developer.  The game developer does game mechanics, asset and some level design development, players do level design, hosting (probably on services like AWS, GCP and/or Azure) and community management.
