# FederatedGameServer Framework
An open-source framework for a cloud-enabled dedicated game server system that allows a game to exist on multiple systems run and managed by a community of people. The idea would be to lower the cost of entry for MMORPGs by allowing the resources to be crowd sourced in essence and divest the cost of managing the server space for a game developer.  The game developer does game mechanics, asset and level design development, players become responsible for hosting (probably on services like AWS,  GCP and/or Azure) and community management. Players may also be provided capability to do level design (similar to moding). Since game server hosting is not a trivial task, system would need an application that automates setting up the server. The system would also use "gates" to allow a player to move in-game from one server to another. This would allow players to integrate multiple scenes into one game all hosted on separate servers.
